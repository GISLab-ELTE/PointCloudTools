PointCloudTools
============

Massive airborne laser altimetry (ALS) point cloud and digital elevation model (DEM) processing library.  
The toolset supports change detection of the built-up area and vegetation, tested primarily on the study dataset [AHN - Actueel Hoogtebestand Nederland](http://www.ahn.nl/).


Build and install
------------

The project is continuously built and tested on Windows 10/11 and Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 LTS.  
See the [Build instructions](BUILD.md) for a detailed guide.


Demo
------------

An interactive visualization of changes in buildings and vegetation for the Dutch AHN point clouds is available at:
